1
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:12,195
A lot of companies now,
they are interested in data analytics.

2
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:15,075
And they have data scientists,
and they've invested a lot.

3
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:17,330
And That's a really
important field,

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,730
but there was only one
problem with it. And that is

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,945
often in data analytics,

6
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:27,545
we have to actually
rely on existing data.

7
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:30,505
Now, here's sort of a set
of issues that we typically run

8
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:33,440
into, and that's why we
need experimentation.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,480
First of all, when it
comes to innovation,

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,045
we often don't have the data
because if the data was already there,

11
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,365
it wouldn't be very
innovative because someone has already

12
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,325
done it before, so it's
not innovative. So by definition,

13
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,685
innovation means that we
usually don't have the data to

14
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:55,870
analyze to begin with. Second
of all, context matters.

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,295
Just because something works
in one sort of area, doesn't

16
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:03,495
mean that it works in another
area. And then finally,

17
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,910
when we do data analytics,
we usually get correlations.

18
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,430
You know, that is
variables correlate with each other.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,870
But correlations

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,595
is not the same as causation.

21
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:19,475
The most fundamental question
that we need to know as

22
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:22,355
managers is whether an
action that we want to take,

23
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:26,900
a management action or
decision actually causes some outcome

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,140
that we sort of aspire
to. The only surefire way

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,205
of actually addressing
causality is to run rigorous

26
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:37,125
controlled experiments.

27
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,885
So if you have a data
analytics program and you're just relying

28
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:44,270
on existing data, you're
you're you're not there yet.

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,745
What you have to do is
you actually have to add experimentation

30
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:52,985
to your toolbox as well,
and the two will actually augment

31
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:55,959
each other. Yep. So that's
what it's all about.
